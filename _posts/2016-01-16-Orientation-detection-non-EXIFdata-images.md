### Problem:

    We've a Enterprise level application which process images from pdf(s). 
    We've to represent those images to exact image Orientation with intelligence.
    User May rotete images if Auto-Rotation Algorithm failed. 
      
### [TESSERACT](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr)

    tesseract(1) is a commercial quality OCR engine originally developed at 
    HP between 1985 and 1995.In 1995, this engine was among the top 3 evaluated
    by UNLV. It was open-sourced by HP and UNLV in 2005 and has been developed
    at Google since then.
   
{% highlight ruby %}
    `tesseract image - -psm 0`
     # > 
     # Orientation: 3
     # Orientation in degrees: 90
     # Orientation confidence: 4.76
     # Script: 1
     # Script confidence: 4.37   
{% endhighlight %}

#### Orientation in degrees is the required amount of Orientation required for image. You may use any imgae-processing library say [ImageMagick](https://github.com/ImageMagick/ImageMagick) example command given below

{% highlight ruby %}
    `convert -rotate #{Orientation in degrees} rotest.jpg rotest90.jpg`
{% endhighlight %}
