#### Problem

We're using `phonegap-plugin-push` to Register and receive push notifications to
ionic applications and unfortunately that's get updated.

Version 2.0.0, this plugin will support CocoaPods installation of the
Firebase Cloud Messaging library.


#### Solution   

Install CocoaPods and re-build the platforms is only the requirement
 
 To install CocoaPods, please follow the installation instructions here.
 
    sudo gem install cocoapods
 
 After installing CocoaPods, please run:
 
    pod setup

This will clone the required CocoaPods specs-repo into your home folder
at ~/.cocoapods/repos, so it might take a while.

    cordova plugin add phonegap-plugin-push@2.0.0
    
and do the build process for android and iOs. You also need a google-services.json
from Firebase to build apk(s).
