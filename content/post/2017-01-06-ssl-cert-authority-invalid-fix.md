#### Happy New Year 


Last year we deployed our rails application over nginx with ssl certificates
obtained from namecheap. everything ewas working fine but over Android moblie
we found a bug as in image below

	<img src="/images/ssl_cert_authority.png">
</figure>


#### Solution   

We got two files from NameCheap for example: 

   *  *youdomainname*.crt
   *  *youdomainname*.ca-bundle


What we missed to combine the certificates(thought ca-bundle is already combination).
We're wrong and our application stopped working on android phone's browser.

It is mandatory to combine the certificates in case of PositiveSSL. It will look like:
   
       $ cat *yourdomainname*.crt COMODO_DV_SHA-256_bundle.crt >> cert_chain.crt
       or
       $ cat *yourdomainname*.crt *yourdomainname*.ca-bundle >> cert_chain.crt


##### Sample nginx configuration

        ssl on;
        # ssl_certificate should be pointed to the file with combined certificates (file you created in step 2)
        ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/cert_chain.crt;
        # ssl_certificate_key should be pointed to the Private Key that has been generated with the CSR code that you have used for activation of the certificate.
        ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/*your_private_key*.key;
