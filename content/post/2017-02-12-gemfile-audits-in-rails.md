#### Problem

Ruby, majorly well-known for rapid web-development via rails.
there are number of `rubygems` coming everyday and un-countable 
versions of existing `rubygems` are released per day. these 
updates may have problems like outdated support,vulnerabilities, bugs
or deprecated features (In general it doesn't happen).This may
end-up project or major downtime.
   
#### Solution

A very useful tool is built into bundler: `bundle outdated`. 
You can see lists installed gems with newer versions available. 
Running bundle outdated looks like this:

        % bundle outdated
        Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
        Fetching version metadata from https://rubygems.org/..
        Fetching dependency metadata from https://rubygems.org/.
        Resolving dependencies....
        
        Outdated gems included in the bundle:
          * gemname (newest 0.11.1, installed 0.9.0) in group "production"
          
          
There are two more gems, those help a-lot and must try those are
           
  * [Gemnasium]('https://gemnasium.com/')          
  * [bundler-audit]('https://github.com/rubysec/bundler-audit')
