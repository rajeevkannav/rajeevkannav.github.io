It allows testing cross platform. It seems easy as such same code base is sufficient enough for both different frameworks.\nThe basic philosophy of Appium is that you should be able to reuse code between iOS and Android, and that’s why when you see the API they are same across iOS and android. Another important thing to highlight here is that unlike Calabash, Appium doesn’t modify your app or need you to even recompile the app.\nYou may choose any of your preferred language as it\u0026rsquo;s an open source project there are wrappers available in every major language.\nAppium Architecture Let’s try to understand what happens behind the scenes.\nAppium server which actullay you download is written in Node.js and that implements the Selenium WebDriver. It allows one to use available WebDriver client to fire your tests and then your mobile app acts precisely like a web app where the DOM is represented by View hierarchy.\nSo this server basically exposes REST api which performs the following actions:\n Receives connection from client Listen command Execute command Respond back the command execution status  In terms of architecture diagram, below is how Appium can be explained.\n `Appium` Architecture  We\u0026rsquo;re going to dive into appium a bit more, and we\u0026rsquo;ll be bind it to ruby in text series.\nAnd if you get stuck… Ask Here  email me rajeevsharma86@gmail.com\n","date":1460160000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460160000,"objectID":"fa3c977ccf5b9596cedcb934ea5c9724","permalink":"/post/2016-04-09-mobile-test-automation-framework-appium-ruby/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016-04-09-mobile-test-automation-framework-appium-ruby/","section":"post","summary":"Appium is an open source test automation tool for mobile applications.

The following diagram illustrates this concept:\nDuring each request, a new token is generated.

The last request in the diagram fails because it tries to use a token that was invalidated by the previous request.\nThe only case where an expired token is allowed is during batch requests.\nAbout batch requests By default, the API should update the auth token for each request (read more). But sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s neccessary to make several concurrent requests to the API, for example:\nBatch request example {% highlight javascript %}\n$scope.getResourceData = function() {\n$http.get('/api/restricted_resource_1\u0026rsquo;).success(function(resp) { // handle response $scope.resource1 = resp.data; });\n$http.get('/api/restricted_resource_2\u0026rsquo;).success(function(resp) { // handle response $scope.resource2 = resp.data; }); };\n{% endhighlight %}\nIn this case, it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to update the access-token header for the second request with the access-token header of the first response because the second request will begin before the first one is complete.

This diagram illustrates how batch requests are identified by the server:\nThe following diagram details the relationship between the client, server, and access tokens used over time when dealing with batch requests:\nNote that when the server identifies that a request is part of a batch request, the user\u0026rsquo;s auth token is not updated. The auth token will be updated for the first request in the batch, and then that same token will be returned in the responses for each subsequent request in the batch (as shown in the diagram).\nAnd if you get stuck… Ask Here  email me  rajeevsharma86@gmail.com\n","date":1435968000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1435968000,"objectID":"da4945bf00c7fed7d76c54c7173d5db4","permalink":"/post/2015-07-04-token-management-interface-thoughts/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2015-07-04-token-management-interface-thoughts/","section":"post","summary":"Conceptual Token Handling Tokens should be invalidated after each request to the API.

Here is a mockup of the project:\nSummarizing, the application will behave as follows:\n When the user creates a new record through the horizontal form, it will be appended to the records table The user will be able to inline-edit any existing record Clicking on any Delete button will remove the associated record from the table Adding, editing or removing an existing record will update the amount boxes at the top of the page  Let\u0026rsquo;s Start {% highlight ruby %}\nFirst things first we need to started our brand new Rails project rails new reactExample\nAdd react-rails to your Gemfile. gem \u0026lsquo;react-rails\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;~\u0026gt; 1.0\u0026rsquo; {% endhighlight %}\nreact-rails comes with an installation script, which will create a components.js file and a components directory under app/assets/javascripts where our React components will live.\n{% highlight ruby %} rails g react:install {% endhighlight %}\nIf you take a look at your application.js file after running the installer, you will notice three new lines:\n{% highlight ruby %} //= require react //= require react_ujs //= require components {% endhighlight %}\n{% highlight ruby %} rails g resource Record title date:date amount:float # Creating the Resource\nrake db:create db:migrate {% endhighlight %}\ndb/seed.rb {% highlight ruby %} Record.create title: \u0026lsquo;Record 1\u0026rsquo;, date: Date.today, amount: 500 Record.create title: \u0026lsquo;Record 2\u0026rsquo;, date: Date.today, amount: -100\nrake db:seed {% endhighlight %}\nNesting Components: Listing Records app/controllers/records_controller.rb {% highlight ruby %} class RecordsController \u0026lt; ApplicationController def index @records = Record.all end end {% endhighlight %}\napp/views/records/index.html.erb {% highlight ruby %} \u0026lt;%= react_component \u0026lsquo;Records\u0026rsquo;, { data: @records } %\u0026gt; {% endhighlight %}\napp/assets/javascripts/components/records.js.coffee {% highlight ruby %} @Records = React.createClass getInitialState: -\u0026gt; records: @props.data getDefaultProps: -\u0026gt; records: [] render: -\u0026gt; React.DOM.div className: \u0026lsquo;records\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.h2 className: \u0026lsquo;title\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;Records\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.table className: \u0026lsquo;table table-bordered\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.thead null, React.DOM.tr null, React.DOM.th null, \u0026lsquo;Date\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.th null, \u0026lsquo;Title\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.th null, \u0026lsquo;Amount\u0026rsquo; React.DOM.tbody null, for record in @state.records React.createElement Record, key: record.id, record: record {% endhighlight %}\napp/assets/javascripts/utils.js.coffee {% highlight ruby %} @amountFormat = (amount) -\u0026gt; \u0026lsquo;$ ' + Number(amount).toLocaleString() {% endhighlight %}\napp/assets/javascripts/components/record.js.coffee {% highlight ruby %} @Record = React.createClass render: -\u0026gt; React.DOM.tr null, React.DOM.td null, @props.record.date React.DOM.td null, @props.record.title React.DOM.td null, amountFormat(@props.record.amount) {% endhighlight %}\nYou can take a look at the resulting code of this section here, And Please wait for Part-2.\nAnd if you get stuck… Ask Here  email me  rajeevsharma86@gmail.com\n","date":1432944000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432944000,"objectID":"c9ff63e50a81e20a9e8ad7625c537ae3","permalink":"/post/2015-05-30-reactjs-rails-start-guide-part-1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2015-05-30-reactjs-rails-start-guide-part-1/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction to React.js React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces by Facebook and Instagram.

It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the resource, and authorizing third-party applications to access the resource. OAuth 2 provides authorization flows for web and desktop applications, and mobile devices.\nOAuth Roles OAuth defines four roles: * Resource Owner * Client * Resource Server * Authorization Server  We will detail each role in the following subsections.\nResource Owner: User The resource owner is the user(resource) who authorizes an application to access their account. The application\u0026rsquo;s access to the user\u0026rsquo;s account is limited to the \u0026ldquo;scope\u0026rdquo; of the authorization granted (e.g. read or write access).\nResource / Authorization Server: API The resource server hosts the protected user accounts, and the authorization server verifies the identity of the user then issues access tokens to the application. From an application developer\u0026rsquo;s point of view, a service\u0026rsquo;s API fulfills both the resource and authorization server roles. We will refer to both of these roles combined, as the Service or API role.\nClient: Application The client is the application that wants to access the user\u0026rsquo;s account. Before it may do so, it must be authorized by the user, and the authorization must be validated by the API.\nAbstract Protocol Flow Now that you have an idea of what the OAuth roles are, let\u0026rsquo;s look at a diagram of how they generally interact with each other:\nAnd if you get stuck… Ask Here  email me  rajeevsharma86@gmail.com\n","date":1429920000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1429920000,"objectID":"c73968eedd68aacb7acd922f0a739980","permalink":"/post/2015-02-21-oauth2-doorkeeper-workflow/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2015-02-21-oauth2-doorkeeper-workflow/","section":"post","summary":"An Introduction to OAuth 2 Introduction OAuth 2 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to resources on an HTTP service, such as Facebook, GitHub, and DigitalOcean.","tags":["Oauth2","Doorkeeper"],"title":"Oauth2 Doorkeeper WorkFlow","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"General Proxying Information One reason to proxy to other servers from Nginx is the ability to scale out your infrastructure. Nginx is built to handle many concurrent connections at the same time. This makes it ideal for being the point-of-contact for clients.\nDeconstructing a Basic HTTP Proxy Pass Let\u0026rsquo;s take a look at an example:\n# server context location /match/here { proxy_pass http://example.com; }  In the above configuration snippet, For definitions that fit this pattern, the URI requested by the client will be passed to the upstream server as-is.\nFor example, when a request for /match/here/please is handled by this block, the request URI will be sent to the example.com server as http://example.com/match/here/please.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take a look at the alternative scenario:\n# server context location /match/here { proxy_pass http://example.com/new/prefix; }  In the above example, the proxy server is defined with a URI segment on the end (/new/prefix). When a URI is given in the proxy_pass definition, the portion of the request that matches the location definition is replaced by this URI during the pass.\nFor example, a request for /match/here/please on the Nginx server will be passed to the upstream server as http://example.com/new/prefix/please. The /match/here is replaced by /new/prefix.
